## Russell Vinegar

### Profile
Recent graduate from the Advanced Diploma in GIS program at 
Selkirk College, I am diving head-first into the geospatial industry. I am a perpetual learner and problem solver, eager to apply technology to solve challenges big and small.

My skillset is centered around Esri software (+ArcPy), in addition to QGIS, ENVI, and FME. I am interested in machine learning and cloud-native geospatial. To that end, I am growing my expertise with Google Earth Engine, TypeScript, and TensorFlow.

I am a clear and engaging communicator, with over 10 yearsâ€™ experience in education and leadership roles. Informed by an interdisciplinary background in environment, I am committed to contributing to a healthy climate and more sustainable food systems.
